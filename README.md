# BioE-230-LAMMPS-MD-
UC Merced BioE 230 Final Project 
Authors: Chris Randolph, Casey Hashimoto 

Simulation is run on LAMMPS 

generates a 2D box with a ploymer in the center 
Polymer can not pass through Y axis barriers 

See comments in code for specific details about the use and purpose of functions.

To run simulation enter 
lmp -in poly.lam 

To change polymer models change 
poly#.input to the correct value

poly.input short chain
poly1.input double length
poly2.input tripple length 


Code is not maintained and will not be updated after May 2022
